<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>We are committed to safeguarding the privacy and confidentiality of all users interacting with our website and services, especially in regard to protected health information (PHI) exchanged through FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) standards. This Privacy Policy outlines our practices for handling, processing, and protecting personal and medical data collected on this site.</p>

<h2>Data Use</h2>

We do not share or sell personal or medical data with third parties for advertising, marketing, or any non-healthcare-related purposes. Any use of the data must comply with applicable privacy laws, including the GDPR, HIPAA, and local data protection regulations.</p>

<h2>Data Storage and Security</h2>
<p>All personal and medical data is stored in secured databases with high-level encryption. Access to this information is strictly limited to authorized personnel who require it to perform healthcare-related services or support. We implement advanced security protocols, including firewalls, data encryption, and secure access controls, to prevent unauthorized access, data breaches, or potential loss of data.</p>

<h2>Data Retention</h2>
<p>We retain personal and medical data only for as long as is necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this policy and to comply with legal, regulatory, or policy requirements. Upon request, and subject to applicable legal restrictions, users have the right to request the deletion of their personal data.</p>

<h2>Data Sharing</h2>
